# minishell

Minishell is a simple shell implementation that replicates basic functionalities of a Unix shell. This project was developed as part of a team effort, where my main
contributions were focused on implementing built-in commands, signal handling, and environment variable expansion (including handling $? for exit status).

### Features
- Command execution with arguments
- Built-in commands: `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`.
- Environment variable handling
- Redirections: input `<`, output `>`, append `>>`, heredoc `<<`
- Pipes `|`
- Signal handling: ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\
- Error handling
